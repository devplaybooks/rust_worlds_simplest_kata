# The World's Simplest Kata: Rust Edition

Welcome to the world's simplest kata! The task is simple. The code creates a simple greeting, but the build is failing.
Make the red Actions in GitHub green. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

For the Rust edition, there are four types of errors: 

- [unit test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html)
- [formatting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
- [linting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
- [doc linting](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/lints.html).

There are several goals for this kata:

* Demonstrate to yourself that you have the Rust tools installed correctly.
* Make sure that you have a GitHub account setup and can fork a repo.
* Show that you are able to fix common errors that will be picked up on a Rust CI build.
* Show how the Rust toolchain helps you to troubleshoot those errors.

## How To

* Fork the repo.
* Make it green.
* ...
* Profit!
