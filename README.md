# The World's Simplest Kata: Rust Edition

Welcome to the world's simplest kata! The task is simple. The build is failing.
The code has one function, and a simple main method.
Make the red Actions in GitHub green. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

For the Rust edition, there are three types of errors: [unit test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html),
[formatting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt), and [linting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy).

There are several goals for this kata:

* Demonstrate to yourself that you have the Rust tools installed correctly.
* Make sure that you have a GitHub account setup and can fork a repo.
* Are able to fix the three most common kind of errors that will be picked up on a Rust CI build: unit test, [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy), and [formatting](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt).

## How To

* Fork the repo.
* Make it green.
* ...
* Profit!
